```
# 0. Load dataset

```{r}
real_estate_df <- read.csv("realestate_texas.csv")
print(head(real_estate_df,5))
print(dim(real_estate_df))
attach(real_estate_df)
```

The dataset has 8 features:

1. city
2. year
3. month
4. sales - number of saled house per that month
5. volume - total revenue per that month in million of dollars
6. median_price - median price in dollars
7. listing - total number of active listings
8. months_inventory - amount of time required to sell all current listings


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
